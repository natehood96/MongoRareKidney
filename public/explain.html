    <h1>Welcome to our site, TAs!</h1>
    <p>
      As you may have noticed, our <a href="/index.html">front end site</a> doesn't appear to contain much in terms of Mongo.
      That's because all the magic is in the <a href="/admin">admin portal</a>. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
      To get into the admin portal go to <a href="/admin">this link</a>. You'll need to authenticate as an admin to get in. Use the following credentials:
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Username: TA<br>
      Password: cs260
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Additionally, notice that the contact entry form at the <a href="/index.html#contact-input">bottom of the home page</a> is connected to the contact view page within the <a href="/admin">admin portal</a>. 
      The <a href="/blog.html">blog page</a> is also connected to the announcements in the <a href="/admin">admin portal</a>.
    </p>

      P.S. This is a website for a real foundation that researches a rare kidney disease affecting one of the developer's families.
